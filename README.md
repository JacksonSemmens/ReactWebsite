# ReactWebsite
This website was created as an excerise in learning a web development framework. React was chosen over competitors such as react due to its high accessible and quick results. This excerise was necessary as through out my time at university my knowledge of web development languages/techniques was based around HTML, CSS, JS and PHP.
